# Text-Classification

Here, I got a list of sentences and classified them as positive or negative sentiment based on how the user has phrased his sentence.

The dataset used here was created by Dimitros Kotzias and he used it in his research paper- From Group to Individual Labels using Deep Features.

The dataset can be found here - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences.

It mainly consists of a list of random sentences from three different websites, where each sentence is labelled 0/1.

Predictions were made using two different Naive Bayes classifier(Multinomial and Bernoulli) and also Logistic Regression and then compared their results.
